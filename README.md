## Tech Stack

**Framework:** Angular 14.1

**UI Library:** TailwindCSS, Angular CDK

**State Management:** Akita

**Unit Test:** Jasmine & Karma


## Lessons Learned

> TailwindCSS and Akita state management are the technologies that I use for the first time. 

> TailwindCSS is highly customizable, developer-friendly utility pattern, enables complex responsive layouts, lightweight and can be optimized using PurgeCSS.

> Akita is easy to pickup, based on object-oriented design principles, fasinatic state management pattern, plugin's  cli and build-in query methods. It is saves the writing boilerplate code to manage application state. I feel right at home with my OOP experience. As my personal point of view, documentation is not solid enough.


## Documentation

I used separated components: Search UI Component & Country Item Component

```typescript
<app-search-ui (filterEvent)="onFilter($event)"></app-search-ui>

<app-country [country]="data"></app-country>
```

To speed up application list view performance, I used Angular CDK Virtual Scorlling.
```typescript
<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>
  <div *cdkVirtualFor="let data of countries$ | async">
    <app-country [country]="data"></app-country>
  </div>
</cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>
```

Fetch data from akita's query methods. No calling direct api call.
```typescript
countries$ = this.countryQuery.selectAll();
```

Call api from state service. And save into the state store.
```typescript
class CountryService {
  get() {
    return this.http.get<Country[]>('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all')
      .pipe(map(countries => countries.map((country, index) => Object.assign(country, { id: index }) )))
      .subscribe(countries => {
      countryStore.set(countries);
    });
  }
}
```

Can know *loading* state and can *filter* by query methods.
```typescript
countryQuery.selectLoading();
countryQuery.selectAll({
  filterBy: [
    (entity: Country) => entity.name.common.toLowerCase().includes(query)
  ]
});
```

Improved user experience with focusing search box by pressing keyboard shortcut implemented `@HostListener` decorator.
```typescript
  @HostListener('document:keydown', ["$event"])
```

Shortcut keys depend on OS and not displaying in small screen like mobile platform (Thanks to Tailwind CSS). CMD + k in Mac and CTRL + k in Windows.
```typescript
type OS = 'Windows' | 'Mac';

<kbd class="invisible lg:visible">
        âŒ˜ K
</kbd>
```

Improved searching performance when we type search keyword.
Not calling search query in every single keypress and same keyword typing by using rxjs operators below.
```typescript
distinctUntilChanged(),
debounceTime(800)
```

We used custom letter only directive for not to type numeric value in search box.
```typescript
<input #searchInput appLetterOnly>
```
